# 🛒 Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior using the **RFM methodology (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**. The goal is to identify high-value customers ("Champions") and potential churners to optimize marketing strategies.

## ❓ Business Problem
The marketing team wants to launch a targeted campaign but lacks insight into customer value. Treating every customer the same leads to budget waste. We need to segment customers based on their actual buying habits.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Technique:** RFM Analysis, Quantile Segmentation

## 📊 Key Insights
After analyzing the transaction data, we found:
1.  **Champions:** Customers who bought recently, frequently, and spent the most.
2.  **Whales:** The top 5% of customers contribute significantly higher revenue per bill compared to the average.
3.  **Actionable Plan:** * *Champions:* Offer exclusive rewards/priority service.
    * *At-Risk:* Send re-engagement emails with discounts.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install requirements: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
3.  Run `w3d11_rfm.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook/VS Code.
